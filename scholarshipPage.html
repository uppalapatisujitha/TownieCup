			                <h2>Preston Pahl Memorial Scholarship</h2>
			            	<hr>
		                </div>
		                <p>Preston’s life was cut short on October 2, 2006. In memory and in honor of this wonderful young man, the Preston Scott Pahl Memorial Scholarship was formed.</p>
						  <br>
						  <h3>Preston's Story</h3>
						  <p>Preston Scott Pahl was a 2003 graduate of Bowling Green High School. He was a three year letterman on the Bobcat hockey team where he served as co-captain his senior year. He was selected as Best Defenseman his junior and senior year and received league academic honors as well. Preston was a member of the football team his freshman and sophomore years and was also active in 4H, FFA and played summer baseball. Preston worked for his father in the family business, Pahl Builders, and was a volunteer youth hockey coach while he attended Hocking College. </p>
						  <p>Preston had a kind smile and quiet confidence. He led by example and was well-respected by his teammates, friends, and teachers. He was polite, respectful, considerate, and just a pleasure to be around. Preston loved the outdoors. He particularly enjoyed hunting, fishing, wakeboarding, boating, and snowmobiling. This love along with the love to help people in need drew him to attend Hocking College where he was pursuing an Associate In Applied Science Degree in Natural Resources Law Enforcement. After serving an internship the summer of 2006 with the Watercraft Division of the Department of Natural Resources he was convinced he had made the right career choice. </p>
						  <p>Preston became engaged Labor Day weekend of 2006 and the wedding was set for June 2007. He and his fiancé, Suzy Dally, were very much in love and had a very strong faith. They were very involved with their church and had a very strong commitment to their families. Preston was returning to Hocking College on the evening of October 2, 2006 when he was involved in an automobile accident. At the age of 21 years, he was taken from his family and friends. </p>
						  <br>
						  <h3>Preston's Scholarship</h3>
						  <p>Preston’s parents, Scott and Sharon Pahl, were so very proud of the fine young man he had become. He was a role model for many of his friends. In his honor, a scholarship was set up in his name, the Preston Scott Pahl Memorial Scholarship. This honor along with a $750 award is given each year to a BGHS student who represents the character and qualities of Preston. Because of the involvement in Preston’s life, specific teachers were selected to have input in the selection process.</p>
						  <br>
						  <h3>Scholarship Qualifications</h3>
						  <p>1) BGHS senior student</p>
						  <p>2) Attending a trade school, 2-year school, or 4-year college</p>
						  <p>3) Exhibits strong commitment to family, friends, teacher, academics and sports</p>
						  <p>4) Exhibits qualities of leadership and sportsmanship</p>
						  <p>Students are nominated by teachers and are asked to write an essay telling about themselves and important influences in their lives. The Pahl family then reviews the essays and selects a recipient. Preston’s sister, Ashley Pahl Schmeltz, typically announces the award winner at the annual awards ceremony.</p>
						  <p>The Preston Pahl Scholarship is held at the Bowling Green Schools Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.</p>
						  <p>Charitable contributions can be made out to: "Bowling Green Schools Foundation" and sent to:</p>

			            <h3>Townie Cup’s Interest</h3>
			            <p>Hockey was one of Preston's passions. Since Preston was an alumni of the BGYHA, the connection was an easy one to make. Along with 
			            	the Preston Scott Pahl Memorial Scholarship given to a Bowling Green High School senior, the Townie Cup also works to raise funds 
			            	for the Preston Pahl Scholarship which helps kids with their BGYHA fees. The kids are asked to submit an essay on an important 
			            	influence in their life and why hockey is important to them. These essays are reviewed and the number of kids helped is dependent on 
			            	funds raised. Townie Cup strives to help as many kids as possible. Townie Cup believes that the BGYHA is a great tool to help build 
			            	wonderful individuals like Preston.</p>

			            <h3>A Tribute to Friendship</h3>
			            <p>Preston was a role model for many of his friends. In an effort to keep his memory alive and as a tribute to their friendship and 
			            	love for him, several of his former hockey teammates began the Preston Scott Pahl Memorial Hockey Game. The first event was held 
			            	in the spring of 2007. The event has continued each spring with increased attendance each year. Recent events have had over 150 
			            	attendees. Former teammates, friends, and family members participate in a friendly hockey game followed by a potluck in the Ice 
			            	Arena Lounge. This is a wonderful memorial to a truly outstanding young man.</p>
